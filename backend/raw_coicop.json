Expenditure incurred by owners, including owner-occupiers, on major maintenance and repair are seen as gross fixed capital formation and thus also outside the scope of COICOP.\r\n\r\nMaterials purchased by tenants or owner-occupiers with the intention of undertaking minor maintenance or repair themselves should be assigned to subclass 04.3.1.1.
